# Distribition Reinforcement Learning

This is a repository where we track progress on DistributionRL in recent years. We revise basic RL concepts and then learn distributional reinforcement learning (credits: Marc Bellemare and Will Dabney) which was introduced in their paper. <br>
### Contents 
- Introduction to RL
- Different architectures of traditional RL
- Introducing Distributional RL
